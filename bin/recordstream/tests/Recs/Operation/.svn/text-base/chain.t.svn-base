Chain Starts with:
  Recs command: recs-xform \$r->rename("foo", "zoo"); __test/testFile
  Passed in memory to Recs command: recs-sort --key zoo=-n
  Passed in memory to Recs command: recs-totable
  Passed in memory to Recs command: recs-grep
    Passed through a pipe to Shell command: bar

# pass along the printer for the operations... Perhaps printers should be
